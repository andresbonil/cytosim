# Cytosim Code Documentation

Cytosim is built around [a core C++ engine](../../src/index.md) under [`src/`](../../src).  
Associated [Python scripts](../../python/index.md) are found under [`python/`](../../python).

The [detailed documentation for the C++ code](doxygen/index.html) needs to be generated.

### Generating the documentation

The code documentation is generated by [`doxygen`](http://www.doxygen.nl).

After installing `doxygen` on your machine, in the project root directory, enter:

	make doc

The output is dumped into [`doc/code/doxygen/`](doxygen).
