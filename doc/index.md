# Installation

Cytosim is distributed as source code and [must be compiled](compile/index.md) before use. On Mac OS X and Linux this should be straightforward if you are familiar with compilation in general. On Windows, we suggest to [compile within Cygwin](compile/cygwin.md).

To compile, enter these commands in a terminal window:

	git clone https://gitlab.com/f.nedelec/cytosim
	cd cytosim
	make

Once cytosim is running on your machine, check the tutorials, the page on [running simulations](main/runs.md), and the examples contained in the folder `cym`. Inspect in particular the short configuration files (e.g. fiber.cym, self.cym). 

#### Troubleshooting

For more information, please check [the dedicated pages](compile/index.md).  
You may need to manually edit the makefiles depending on your platform.
