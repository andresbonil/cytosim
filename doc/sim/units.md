# Physical units in Cytosim
 
 Cytosim is not aware of units, and the user's responsability to provide coherent values. The parameters could thus in principle be specified in any system of units, but the same system must be used consistently for all values! However, for convenience, cytosim provides default values for some parameters, and this is done in a particular system of units. Specifically:

 Parameter   | Default value    |
 ------------|-------------------
 viscosity   | 1      pN.s/um^2
 kT          | 0.0042 pN.um

 It is therefore very strongly advised to adhere to this system, and to convert all parameter values before using them in cytosim. It is in any case a convenient set of units for cytoskeletal work. Cytosim's system of units:

 Quantity    | Unit        | Symbol | Value                           |
 ------------|-------------|--------|----------------------------------
 Distance    | micrometer  | um     | 10^(-6) = 0.000001 meter
 Force       | picoNewton  | pN     | 10^(-12) = 0.000000000001 Newton
 Time        | second      | s      | 1/60 minute
 Angle       | radian      | rad    | PI radian = 180 degrees


 The most common physical quantities have these units:

 Parameter          | Units     |
 -------------------|------------
 duration           |  s
 length or range    |  um
 force              |  pN
 rate               |  1/s
 torque             |  pN.um
 speed              |  um/s
 diffusion constant |  um^2/s
 stiffness          |  pN/um
 angular stiffness  |  pN.um/rad
 energy             |  pN.um
 bending elasticity |  pN.um^2
 viscosity          |  pN.s/um^2
 
The number of objects are usually specified directly. Thus if you know a concentration,
you simply need to multiply by the volume of the cell. The binding and unbinding rates are
specified as molecular rate (1/s) and knowing the equilibrium constant of the reaction is
usually not sufficient to deduce both rate, although knowing the equilibrium constant should
help you to constrain the ratio of the two.
