# Getting numbers out of Cytosim using `report`

You can extract formatted data from Cytosim in two different ways:

- by using the `report` command in the configuration file.
- by running the `report` executable on the trajectory file.

Both methods produce nearly identical formatted text output with selected data,
such as the coordinates of the filaments, their state or length, etc.
 
# The `report` command

The command `report` can be called from the config file.
The report will be generated by `sim` in the course of the simulation (and ignored by `play`).
The output can be sent to a specific files, for example:

	repeat 100
	{
		run 100 system
		{
		    nb_frames = 100
		}
		report fiber:force forces.txt
		report solid:position positions.txt
	}

A 'star' sends the reports to the terminal:
	
	run 1000 system
	
	report single:force *
	report fiber:force *


# The `report` executable

If the simulation is already completed, you can use a separate executable called `report` to analyse the results. In this case `report` will read [cytosim's output files](../main/file_types.md), and is limited to the frames that have been saved.

It is important to use a `report` made with the same settings as `sim`, in particular the dimensionality `DIM` defined in `dim.h` should be the same.
To compile `report`:

	make report
	
Invoke the `report` executable from the command line:

	report fiber:force

This will analyse all the frames in the trajectory file, and send the output to the terminal. 
Example output:
	
	% frame   10
	% time    25
	% identity      posX      posY    forceX    forceY   tension
	% fiber f1:0001
	         1    -4.142    -2.815     1.366    0.9282    -1.061
	         1    -3.796   -0.8463         0         0   -0.8617
	         1    -3.061     1.006         0         0   -0.7094
	         1   -0.8413     2.949         0         0   -0.6838
	         1     1.108     3.346         0         0   -0.8099
	         1     3.093     3.136         0         0    -1.004
	         1     4.069      2.92     -1.36    -0.976         0


It is possible to redirect the output to a file in UNIX:

	report fiber:points > fiber_points.txt

You can also restrict reporting to a particular frame:

	report fiber:points frame=10 > fiber_points.txt

or to some selected frames:

	report fiber:points frame=10,20,30 > fiber_points.txt

# The `framewise report` executable

The executable `reportF` is similar to `report`, excepts that it sends the report of each frame into a different file. Hence,

	reportF fiber:points

will create multiple files:

	report0000.txt
	report0001.txt
	report0002.txt
	report0003.txt
	...
