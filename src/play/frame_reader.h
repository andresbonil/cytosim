/// Helper class to access a particular frame in a trajectory file
/** 
 FrameReader is used to find a particular frame (eg. frame 10) in a trajectory file.
 FrameReader will handle basic IO failures and will remember the starting positions
 of all frames that were sucessfully identified, using this information to speed up
 future access to these and other frames in the same file. For example, if the 
 position of frame 50 is known and frame 60 is requested, it will start searching
 the file from the end of frame 50.

 FrameReader makes minimal assumptions on what constitutes a 'frame':
 - seekFrame() looks for a string that identifies the beggining of a frame (Cytosim).
 - loadFrame() calls Simul::reloadObjects() to read the content of the frame.
 .
 
 Frames are recorded starting at index 0.
