/**
 This class describes a thin flexible filament that is longitudinally incompressible.
 The curvilinear length of the filament can be changed by growP(), growM(), cutP() and cutM().
 
 \par Number of points:
 
 The best number of points to describe a Chain is automatically calculated:
 It is the integer `number_of_points` that minimizes:
 
    fabs( length() / number_of_points - FiberProp::segmentation )
 
 where segmentation is a parameter of the fiber class.
 All the segments in a fiber all have the same length

    Chain::segmentation() = length() / ( number_of_points - 1 )

 Note that Chain::segmentation() is not always equal to FiberProp::segmentation.
 If the fibers have various length, their segmentation() will be different,
 even though they all share the same value of FiberProp::segmentation.

 See related functions: length(), nbPoints() and segmentation().
 
 \par Longitudinal incompressibility:
 
 Successive vertices are kept at a constant distance via constrained dynamics:

    norm( posP(N+1)-posP(N) ) == Chain::segmentation()
 
 \par Origin:
 
 An abscissa is a curvilinear distance taken along the Fiber,
 and the Chain provides an origin to make this independent of the vertices. 
 Thus even if the fiber lengthen from its ends, a position described by an abscissa will
 stay associated with the same local lattice site.
 
 Functions are provided in Chain to convert abscissa measured from different references,
 and to obtain positions of the fiber for a given abcissa.

 \par Derived classes:
 
 The class FiberSite keeps track of its position using an abscissa from the origin,
 and all Hand objects are built from this class.
 The class Fiber keeps track of the FiberSite that are attached to itself.
