/// Simulates the stochastic binding/unbinding of a FiberSite
/**
 A Hand is always part of a larger construct, for example Single or Couple.
 
 Hand is the parent to many class that implement different fiber-related activities.
 Hand provides binding/unbinding capacity to these derived classes.
 
 Attachment occurs with constant rate @ref HandPar "attach_rate" to any fiber located
 at distance  @ref HandPar "attach_range" or less.
 If attachment occurs, it happens on the closest point of the fiber,
 which is either the projection of the current position on the fiber axis, 
 or one of the fiber end.
 
 You can restrict binding to happen only near the ends by setting `bind_only_end`,
 and the associated cutoff distance `bind_end_range`.

 Detachment increases exponentially with force:

     off_rate = unbinding_rate * exp( force.norm() / unbinding_force )
